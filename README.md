# Robot Vacuum (Dusty Bot)
Final project in grade 12 robotics. 
Parts for the robot:
- Cardboard shell
- Plastic container with metal-wire handle (vacuum container)
- Computer fan (vacuuming mechanism)
- 1 styrofoam piece (sweeper)
- Arduino
- 1 pair of motors with wheels
- 1 proximity sensor
- 1 power switch

Due to the unfortunate quality of the motors purchased, the vacuum has to move in a start-and-stop fashion. Otherwise, it detects and avoids obstacles using the proximity sensor, and reverses when it is stuck in a spot.
